# Timeline features {#design_features}
The Timeline object is not designed to be extened in the same way as the Event objects are, as it doesn't support inheritance. However, user can still extend the timeline's functionality by implementing Timeline Features.  
Timeline Feature can be any user-defined data structure // TODO maybe tutorial?
